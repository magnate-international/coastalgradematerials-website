            <div class="blurb-content">Crushed granite is a versatile construction aggregate produced by crushing quarried granite rock into angular fragments. 
            It inherits the mineral composition of its parent rock, typically including quartz, feldspar, and mica. These minerals contribute to its hardness, durability, and resistance to weathering. 
            The crushing process creates fragments with sharp, angular edges. This angularity is crucial for interlocking and compaction, providing stability and load-bearing capacity in construction applications. 
            Crushed granite is available in various size gradations, from coarse aggregates to fine aggregates.
            <br></br>
        <b>Advantages of Crushed Granite</b>
        <li>Strength and Durability: It can withstand heavy loads and resist weathering, making it suitable for demanding applications.</li>
        <li>Excellent Interlocking: The angular shape of the fragments provides strong interlocking, leading to stable and compact surfaces.</li>
        <li>Good Drainage: Its permeability allows water to drain effectively, preventing water accumulation and related damage.</li>
        <li>Versatility: Crushed granite's various sizes and properties make it adaptable for a wide range of construction and landscaping uses.</li>
        <li>Natural Appearance: It offers a natural and aesthetically pleasing look, particularly in landscaping applications.</li>

            <div class="blurb-content">Crushed limestone, derived from sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), is a widely used aggregate in construction and various other applications. 
                Compared to granite, limestone is generally softer, with a Mohs hardness ranging from 3 to 4. 
                This makes it easier to crush but also less resistant to abrasion in certain applications. 
                Crushing produces fragments with varying degrees of angularity. 
                While some pieces have sharp edges, others are more rounded, influencing their interlocking ability.
                <br></br>
                <b>Advantages of Crushed Limestone</b>
                <li>Good Workability: Its relative softness makes it easier to crush and handle compared to harder rocks like granite.</li>
                <li>Versatility: Crushed limestone's various sizes and properties make it adaptable for a wide range of construction and other uses.</li>
                <li>Environmental Benefits: Using limestone in cement production can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to other cement-making processes.</li>

            <div class="blurb-content">Silica aggregate, primarily composed of silicon dioxide (SiO2), is a hard, durable material widely used in construction, industrial processes, and various other applications. 
                It occurs naturally in various forms, most notably as quartz and sand. 
                Quartz is a crystalline form of silica with high hardness (7 on the Mohs scale) and resistance to weathering. 
                Silica sand is fine granular material composed of small quartz particles. 
                Crushed quartzite is metamorphic rock composed mainly of quartz, offering high strength and durability. 
                Silica aggregate is known for its exceptional hardness and resistance to abrasion, making it suitable for demanding applications. 
                It's chemically inert, meaning it doesn't readily react with most chemicals, making it suitable for various industrial processes. 
                Silica has a high melting point (around 1700Â°C), making it suitable for high-temperature applications.
